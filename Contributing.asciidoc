== Reporting bugs

First, some basic things:

* Use only English to communicate with developers.
* If you can, please check if the problem has been fixed in development version
  (if you are using a stable release or old version).
* Report only one bug or feature request per issue.

=== Security reports

Please *DO NOT* file a GitHub issue for security related problems, but send an
email to <security@weechat.org> instead.

=== Required info

When reporting https://github.com/weechat/weechat/issues[issues] on GitHub,
please include:

* your *WeeChat version*: the output of `/v` in WeeChat, for example:
  'WeeChat 1.0-dev (git: v0.4.3-475-gb174b3c)'. +
  If WeeChat does not start at all, please include the version displayed by
  `weechat --help` (or the version installed with your package manager).
* your *operating system*: its name and version (examples: Linux Debian Wheezy,
  FreeBSD 10.0, Windows/Cygwin 64-bit, ...).
* the *steps to reproduce*: if possible, please include a reproducible example:
  explain the steps which led you to the problem. +
  It's even better if you can reproduce the problem with a new config (and no
  scripts loaded): try `weechat --dir /tmp/weechat` and check if you have the
  problem here.
* the *gdb's backtrace* (only for a crash): if you can reproduce the crash
(or if you have a core file), please include the backtrace from gdb (look at
http://weechat.org/files/doc/devel/weechat_user.en.html#report_crashes[User's guide]
for more info).

[IMPORTANT]
Most of times, the WeeChat crash log file ('weechat_crash_YYYYMMDD_xxx.log') is
*NOT USEFUL* to fix the bug, so please report this file *ONLY* if a developer
asked you to send it (and be extremely careful, this file can contain personal
data like passwords and contents of your chats).

=== Scripts related issues

If you are using scripts, they can cause problems/crashes. To check if the
problem is related to one script, try to unload them one by one (using
command `/script unload <name>`).

Many issues reported are in fact related to bugs in scripts, so please first
check that before reporting any issue on WeeChat itself.

If you think the problem comes from a specific script, please report the issue
in the https://github.com/weechat/scripts/issues[scripts git repository]
instead.

== Translations

Pull requests on GitHub for fixes or new translations are welcome at any
time, for https://github.com/weechat/weechat[WeeChat] and
the web site https://github.com/weechat/weechat.org[weechat.org].

To start a translation in a new language (not yet supported), please look at
http://weechat.org/files/doc/devel/weechat_dev.en.html#translations[translations]
in Developer's guide.

== Feature requests

WeeChat is under active development, so your idea may already have been
implemented, or scheduled for a future version (you can check in
http://weechat.org/dev/[roadmap] or
https://github.com/weechat/weechat/milestones[milestones] on GitHub.

Pull requests on GitHub are welcome for minor new features.

For major new features, it's better to discuss about it in IRC
(server: 'chat.freenode.net', channel '#weechat').
